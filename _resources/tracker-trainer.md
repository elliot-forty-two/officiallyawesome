{% include unity unity_dir="/assets/unity/trackertrainer" %}

A focus and memory exercise for roller derby skating officials.

Familiarise yourself with the instructions and then complete the information tracking tasks while simultaneously undertaking physical activity.

Some options for suitable physical challenges include:
- Grapevines - on or off skates
- Box/cross stepping - on or off skates
- Squats
- Juggling (solo) or playing catch if you are doing this with a peer
- Catching a stream of playing cards (you will need someone to throw them at you!)
- Anything else that gets you moving and still allows you to follow the screen!

The more demanding the activity is of your body and of your attention, the harder this will be.

## Track the pack!

In the simulation, the pack can be in one of three positions: front, middle and rear.

The arrows that appear on the left and right of the screen move the pack one step in that direction along this line.

Sometimes an arrow may appear that cannot move the pack.

For example, when the pack is already in the front location, the left arrow will have no effect on its position - only the right arrow will shift it back to the middle, and two right arrows in succession will move the pack all the way to the rear position.

Your goal is to mentally keep track of the pack's location as it shifts over the course of the exercise.

## Points!

Roller derby is a game in which nothing ever happens in isolation, and a roller derby official must be skilled at processing multiple information streams simultaneously.

In addition to tracking the pack location, you must also attempt to count the score.

Points appear in the middle of the screen in the forms of stars. 1 star = 1 point.

Keep a running total of the points that are amassed over the course of the game.

The point total is reset to zero when you see the curved arrow symbol.

Think of it as representative of the jammer leaving the front of the engagement zone after completing a scoring trip - a new trip is about to begin and therefore we will start to count again from 0. The pack location IS NOT reset - only the points.

## Starting the game

The pack starts in the middle position.

The points start at 0.

Keep track of both things as they shift throughout the video.

At the end of each section, or jam, you will be asked to identify where the pack is and what the score is for the current trip.

Ready? Hit Start above to begin!
