## Resources used this week
- [The Rules of Roller Derby](https://rules.wftda.com)
- [Magnetic Whiteboard](/magnetic-whiteboard/) (based off the WONDERFUL resource Vienna Roller Derby. This has been created by Vienna Roller Derby and they've recently updated it to include being able to show a skater who is down and add more accessibility features. [urdumb.org](https://urdumb.org/))
- [WFTDA officiating cues, codes and signals](https://static.wftda.com/officiating/wftda-officiating-cues-codes-and-signals.pdf)
- [WFTDA penalty quick reference guide](https://static.wftda.com/officiating/wftda-penalty-quick-reference-guide.pdf)
- Exercise for Session 3 (helping Pack Definition and Engagement Zone work): Choose two objects (whether when you're out and about on a walk or in your house) that you think are 10ft from each other or 20 ft from each other. Then take a tape measure and see how accurate you are! OR choose one object and decide where you think 10ft/20ft is.
- Additional resource for Session 2 Exercise: The wonderful Holtz, London Roller Derby's Head NSO and Ref School chat moderator extraordinaire, has turned the YouTube memory video from last week into an actual game! You can find it here: [Tracker Trainer](/tracker-trainer/) (do let us know if you have any feedback as Holtz is very happy to update, fix and adapt it!)
