- Just Dance exercises: Go to YouTube and google "Just Dance". Find a video that has both a main character dancing in the screen and the little characters with symbols in the bottom right hand corner. Practice and build up your ability to focus on multiple things at the same time. Firstly, focusing in on the main character (or bottom left) and practise the dance a few times.  Then, try to see both at the same time or very close together so you're not missing a dancing beat! You should notice that after a while you start to notice them more easily - but don't rush yourself. Give your brain time to adjust to focusing in on multiple things.
