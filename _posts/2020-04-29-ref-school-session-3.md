There are so many people and so many rules and so little time! We want to find a way to help expand things that suits most people. We have started a poll on Facebook - please do fill it in.

A. Keep the session 60 minutes but add 30 minutes for questions and free-form chat at the end.
B. Extend the session to 75 minutes.
C. Extend the session to 90 minutes.

The video will go up on YouTube within 24 hours of the session. We are then asking members of the community to add accurate subtitles, which will take a few days. We can’t guarantee YouTube automated ones will be good. For folks who weren’t in the session there was a very active chat thread. If you've got any questions please let us know - either on Facebook, YouTube comments or email us.
